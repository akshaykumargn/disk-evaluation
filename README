The script was written to evaluate disk user information and save it to the excel file with information such as File name, Author, Size and Latest modified timesamp. Each excel was created to save the data for different file extensions such as .odb, .bof and so on. Further the data was segregated based on user in different sheets of the excel file in descending order of file size.

This script serves the following main purposes:

1. Data Collection: It scans the system's disk for files with specific extensions, extracts user-related information, and compiles this data for further analysis.
2. Organization: The script creates separate Excel files for each file extension to maintain data organization and clarity.

3. User Segmentation: Within each Excel file, the data is segregated into different sheets based on user accounts, making it easy to identify usage patterns and storage distribution.
